# Shader 1: Color Correction
The first shader I made was the color correction shader, but what was the implementation process for what I did and why I decided to implement it the way I did.
Diagram:

Task: Implement Color Correction Shader for Yoshi Game -> What art style I wanted to make out of it -> realistic -> basic color correction shader was implemented referencing lecture content -> when should an object be color corrected within the game? -> when yoshi needs to rest due to excessive attacking -> adds a sinetime to the color correction specifically for the alpha variable -> makes yoshi flash a color while maintaining yoshi's texture but tells the player yoshi can't shoot 

This was the basic breakdown on what I did with the color correction shader and the diagram in which I tackled issues when and why I made it the way I did. 
Now for a more indepth explanation of how the shader operates and why I made this decision.
